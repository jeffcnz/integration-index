Interpolation function not working Fixed


Currently only constructing url, not posting request or doing any translation. Sorted, but template needs improved
Only Hilltop support, plus Kisters Hydstra but not tested
Need to add logic so that water quality seperate request construction than continuous - done but not tested.

Add checking logic, if parameter not part of site offering return error
Add error checking throughout, time and procedure

Check daily average interpolation type for Hilltop

Current Kisters implementation is SOS, not native calls.


ARC - Site ID doesn't appear correct in WFS, isn't the name to call for the ts url.
	- Water quality data, how request

WRC - what are the ts calls and what does the response look like for water quality

HRC - what is the water quality ts url.
